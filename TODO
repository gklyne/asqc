asqc TODO

Factor out tests to separate test suite
Packaging for easy installation
Alternative RDF formats
Alternative binding formats
(Think about preprocessing query with bindings - needs SPARQL tokenizer to do properly)

Note: to install package directly from git:
  pip install git+https://github.com/RDFLib/rdfextras.git 

But see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3777075/https-github-access for dealing with https certificate validation
