== asqc TODO ==

Improve error handling, especially for query syntax (option to check query syntax?)
Refactor StdinContext and StdoutContext to MiscLib; update packaging to include MiscLib as extra?
Alternative RDF formats
Alternative binding formats
(Think about preprocessing query with bindings - may need SPARQL tokenizer to do properly)
