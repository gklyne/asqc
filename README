This project is for a simple command-line SPARQL query client.

The plan is that the client can be used in Unix-style pipeline operations to perform sequences of query operations that pass information as RDF (from CONSTRUCT queries) or variable bindings (from SELECT queries).

== Installation ==

Assumes Python 2.7 installed; not yet tested with other versions.

Installation is from Python Package Index (PyPI).

=== MacOS / Linux ===

==== Temporary installation ====

Select working directory, then:
[[
virtualenv testenv
source testenv/bin/activate
pip install asqc
]]

When finished, from the same directory:
[[
deactivate
rm -rf testenv
]]

==== System-wide installation (needs root privileges) ====

[[
sudo pip install asqc
]]

If older versions of rdflib and/or other utilities are installed, it may be necessary to force an upgrade, thus:
[[
sudo pip install --upgrade asqc
]]
